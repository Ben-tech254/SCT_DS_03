This project entailed building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic data and their behavioral data.

The following are the steps that I followed:

-Loading the dataset

-Exploring the dataset so that I could understand it

-Check for missing values and filling in the missing values

-Check for duplicate values in the dataset

-Conversion of the categorical variables to numerical values

-Splitting the datasets into features and the target

-Splitting the data into train sets and test sets

-Training the model

-Evaluate the accuracy of the model's predictions

Tools used:

-Python

-Pandas

-Numpy

-Scikit-learn
